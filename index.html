    <p><em>Border Patrol</em> is an <a href="http://gow.epsrc.ac.uk/NGBOViewGrant.aspx?GrantRef=EP/N028201/1">EPSRC funded research project</a> as part of the <a href="https://www.epsrc.ac.uk/funding/calls/trustidentityprivacysecurity/">Trust, Identity, Privacy and Security in the Digital Economy</a> call.
      We are a collaborative project between the Universities of Glasgow, Heriot-Watt, and Imperial College London.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our goal is to make the design of hardware systems, and in particular smart devices, resiliant against hidden malicious functionality by ensuring that devices only do what is expected of them.
      It is an ambitious project that combines state-of-the-art advances in type theory and compiler technology, and applies them to hardware design.
      You can read more about the ideas behind the project <a href="about.html">here</a>.
    </p>

    <p>We will focus our work on FPGA-based smart devices, and to ensure that our ideas can gain traction, we will work closely with several Industrial partners.
      We are working with Xilinx Inc., one of the main FPGA vendors, to integrate our approach into their toolchain, and we are working closely with our other partners, EDF and ABB, on requirements capture and standardisation.</p>

<p>This is a very exciting project and we believe that it will lead to greatly improved security of smart devices, and in fact to improved productivity and increased reliability in hardware design in general.</p>
