Rob gave a talk at the _Adaptive Many-Core Architectures and Systems
workshop_
([link](https://www-users.york.ac.uk/~mt540/graceful-ws/index.html)),
at the University of York, on future FPGA-based graph reduction
architectures for accelerating non-strict pure functional programming
languages such as Haskell.

The talk was also presented at _Trends in Functional Programming
(TFP)_ in Gothenburg, Sweden, on 13th June, 2018.
