title: Mapping dataflow programs to FPGAs

...

Rob gave a talk on mapping dataflow programs to FPGAs at the Scottish
Programming Language Seminar series at the University of the West of
Scotland.

> FPGAs are unlike fixed, conventional processor architectures. FPGAs
> are programmable, meaning that logic gates and special purpose
> hardware blocks can be configured to precisely meet the needs of
> algorithms. Dataflow languages map naturally to the distributed
> hardware layout on FPGA fabric, and offer a high level programming
> abstraction to design FPGA accelerators.
>
> This talk will cover dataflow language models, from synchronous
> actors supporting signal processing, to asynchronous FSM actors
> supporting complex non-trivial algorithms. I will demonstrate how a
> hardware cost modeller is used in conjunction with a graphical
> program refactoring tool we have developed, to trade off throughput
> time with space. Our Petri Net dataflow abstraction aids parallelism
> discovery of stateful actors, to increase the generality of the
> program transformations. I will briefly present our image processing
> DSL, showing how the Dataflow Process Network model is an effective
> intermediary between higher order algorithm skeletons and FPGAs.
